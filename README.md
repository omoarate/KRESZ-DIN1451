# KRESZ-DIN1451
Hungarian road sign font

This is not a 100%, 1:1 copy of the DIN-1451 variant used on road signs in Hungary, but it's close to it: the straight accents on letters, the wide/narrow variants, and the modified type of numbers 4, 6, 7 and 9, the modified shape of letters Y and S, that have a curved end, compared to the straight one defined by the normal DIN-1451 font.

All glyphs in these fonts closely resemble the ones defined [here](https://ume.kozut.hu/dokumentum/1317).
