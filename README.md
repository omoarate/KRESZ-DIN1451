These fonts are not  100%, 1:1 copies of the DIN-1451 variants (Narrow, Normal and Wide) used on road signs in Hungary, but closely resemble them: the straight accents on letters, the wide/narrow variants, and the modified type of numbers 4, 6, 7 and 9 (6 and 9 have a curved end, the top part of the number 7 is straight, and the number 4 has all its lines connected), the modified shape of letters Y (lowercase) and S (capital and lowercase), in comparision with the ones defined by the normal DIN-1451 fonts.

All glyphs in these fonts closely resemble the ones defined [here](https://ume.kozut.hu/dokumentum/1317).
